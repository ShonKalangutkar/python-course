# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators: Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations
# Assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
# Comparison operators: Comparison operators are used to compare two values
# Logical operators : Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements
# Identity operators : Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location
# Membership operators: Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
# Bitwise operator: Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers
